            This summary covers the essentials of using our service: what we provide, what you
            agree to, and how your information is handled. Prices, taxes, and fees are shown before
            you pay; subscriptions auto‑renew unless cancelled; ticket refunds follow each
            organizer’s policy. We collect only the data needed to run the platform (account,
            event/ticket, check‑in, support, and limited analytics) and share it only with service
            providers, organizers (for their events), or when the law requires. You must use the
            service lawfully, protect your account, and respect others’ rights; we may suspend
            misuse. You can access, update, or delete your data where available. Details for each
            topic appear in the sections below.

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>6)</strong> To the maximum extent permitted by law, our liability is limited
